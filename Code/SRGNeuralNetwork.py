# SRG Neural Network

# Version 1.0.0
# August 13, 2019
#
# A child class of Restore, useful when a neural network
# is trained on SRG matrices.  
# Currently only compares the diagonals of the SRG matrices
# to the true eigenvalues.

# OUTLINE:
# SRGNeuralNetwork (Restore): A child class of restore that provides 
# additional functions for analysis of SRG matrices created with the 
# neural network.
# 
#    __init__(self, weights_file, biases_file): Imports the trained weights 
#    and biases using the initializer of Restore.
#
#   get_diags (self, lst): Returns the diagonals of a matrix sorted by size.
#
#   compare_eigenvalues(self, prediction_values, true_value): Compares the 
#   diagonals from predicted SRG matrices to the exact eigenvalues of the starting
#   matrix.
